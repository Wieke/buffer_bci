PsychoPy Integration
====================

Here are three toy examples of PsychoPy/buffer_bci integration based on a simple imagined movement task, it only considers the stimulus presentation part of the experiment. The folders contain the following:

* *original* contains the original unmodified experiment, which is not integrated in any way.
* *codeExample* was integrated by inserting appropriate code using the code view.
* *pythonModuleExample* was integrated by using the build-in python code module.
* *customModuleExample* was integrated using a custom buffer_bci integration module.
